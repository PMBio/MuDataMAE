\usage{
writeH5AD(object, file, overwrite = TRUE, ...)

\S4method{writeH5AD}{Matrix_OR_DelayedMatrix,H5IdComponent}(object, file, overwrite, write_dimnames = TRUE)

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The object to save.}

\item{file}{Name of the file to save to.}

\item{overwrite}{Currently unused.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}

\item{write_dimnames}{Whether to export colnames and rownames.}
}
\value{
NULL, invisibly
}
\description{
Note that NA values are not supported by HDF5, and therefore by h5ad. The behavior of this
function if NAs are present is undefined.

data(miniACC, package="MultiAssayExperiment")
